Bluetooth may not be enabled by default in Kali on current version of Kali. You need to enable it manually, here are the steps:

```sh
sudo apt install bluetooth
```
and then
```sh
sudo systemcli enable bluetooth.service
```
Then you can connect with the speakers and use bluetooth on HackberryPi_CM5 in Kali
