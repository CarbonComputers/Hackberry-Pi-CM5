# Screen on HackberryPi_CM5

Thanks to raspberrypi fundation that they leave dpi interface on each RaspberryPi, this gives the chance for the pi to drive normal rgb display very easily. More information please check the doc in this page.

On HackberryPi_CM5 there is a 3.95 inch 720*720 resolution RGB666 display with touchscreen on board.

The hardware needed is basically a fpc connector for the display and the backlight light boost circuit to drive 3.3V to around 12V to drive the backlight LEDs.
