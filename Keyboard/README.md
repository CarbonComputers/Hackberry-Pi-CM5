# Keyboard on HackberryPi_CM5

There are currently 3 versions of keyboards for HackberryPi_CM5: Q10 Q20 and 9900 keyboards

Different keyboard has its own style

* Q10: Q10 keyboard has linear layout and the keycap is slightly smaller than the Q20, the original Q10 keyboard has no top row keys and trackpad, I use the trackpad from 9900 and add another top row keys with PS game controller icon on it.
* Q20: Q20 keyboard has linear layout and has the largest keycap, but there the trackpad on Q20 keyboard is the smallest and it has no backlight around the trackpad.
* 9900: 9900 keyboard has ergonomic smile layout, the keycap is the smallest one.
